# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day 

# Description

This website hosts a daily scheduler. The page displays the current time and date and the time blocks change colour according to the time of day. Time blocks in the past display in a faded orange colour (orange with lower opacity), the current time block displays in pink, and the future time blocks display in bright orange. 

The site is deployed at: https://lydiabarham.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

# Usage

Use the input box in each time block to enter the event/ activity. Press save to store it in a list within the time block. 

The events are stored in local storage and will persist when the page is refreshed. 

To remove an event, click the checkbox and it will delete the list item and remove it from local storage.
